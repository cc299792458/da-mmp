    <p>
      Dynamic manipulation is a key capability for advancing robot performance, enabling skills such as tossing. 
      While recent learning-based approaches have pushed the field forward, most methods still rely on manually designed action parameterizations, limiting their ability to produce the highly coordinated motions required in complex tasks. 
      Motion planning can generate feasible trajectories, but the dynamics gap—stemming from control inaccuracies, contact uncertainties, and aerodynamic effects—often causes large deviations between planned and executed trajectories. 
      In this work, we propose Dynamics-Aware Motion Manifold Primitives (DA-MMP), a motion generation framework for goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation, and instantiate it on a challenging real-world ring-tossing task.
      Our approach extends motion manifold primitives to variable-length trajectories through a compact parametrization and learns a high-quality manifold from a large-scale dataset of planned motions. 
      Building on this manifold, a conditional flow matching model is trained in the latent space with a small set of real-world trials, enabling the generation of throwing trajectories that account for execution dynamics.
      Experiments show that our method can generate coordinated and smooth motion trajectories for the ring-tossing task.
      In real-world evaluations, it achieves high success rates and even surpasses the performance of trained human experts.
      Moreover, it generalizes to novel targets beyond the training range, indicating that it successfully learns the underlying trajectory–dynamics mapping.

      <!-- Problem -->
      <h3 class="subheading">Problem</h3>
      <p class="method-text">
        In this project, we address a real-world robotic ring-tossing task. 
        The task is challenging due to the need for <strong>highly coordinated, high-speed motions</strong> and <strong>dynamics gaps stemming from control, contact, and aerodynamics</strong>. 
        The goal is to produce a joint trajectory \( \tau \) that releases a grasped ring to land around a distant peg accurately.

      <!-- Key Idea -->
      <h3 class="subheading">Key Idea</h3>
      <p class="method-text">
        DA-MMP generates dynamics-aware throwing trajectories in two stages: 
        (I) build a <strong>low-dimensional motion manifold</strong> from a large set of planned trajectories, and 
        (II) align this manifold to <strong>real execution dynamics</strong> using a conditional flow-matching policy trained with few real trials.
      </p>

      <!-- Phase A: Data Collection -->
      <h3 class="phase-heading">Stage I. Data Collection</h3>
      <div class="method-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Goal-Manifold Sampling</h4>
          <p>
            We adopt goal-manifold sampling to generate candidate throwing states.
            By leveraging projectile equations and task geometry, each candidate specifies a feasible end-effector pose and velocity at release.
            Infeasible candidates are rejected, yielding a goal manifold.

          <h4>Sampling-Based Motion Planning</h4>
          <p>
            Given a feasible throwing state, we use a kinodynamic planner (DIMT-RRT) to generate motion trajectories.
            Each plan is refined with shortcut smoothing and validated through collision checks and stability tests,
            resulting in a large-scale dataset of feasible throwing trajectories.

          <h4>Variable-Length Trajectory Parameterization</h4>
          <p>
            To parameterize variable-length motion trajectories without distorting the release velocity,
            we explicitly include trajectory length in the parameterization.
            Inspired by via-point movement primitives, we use gated radial basis functions combined with a cubic Hermite spline that enforces start and end conditions
            to parameterize trajectories in a smooth and consistent manner.
            Each trajectory is parameterized by its length, boundary conditions, and basis weights.

          <h4>Learning Motion Manifold Primitives</h4>
          <p>
            We train an autoencoder on the full parameterized trajectories dataset to learn a high-quality, low-dimensional motion manifold.
            On top of this latent space, a conditional flow-matching model is trained on few real-world trials to align planned trajectories with real execution dynamics,
            using observed landing outcomes as conditioning signals.
            This design enables dynamics-aware trajectory generation with strong data efficiency.
